# AQI Prediction using Deep Learning (ANN)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Deep Learning-based **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Delhi. Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, the model uses processed environmental and pollutant datasets, applies feature scaling, and is evaluated on MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics to deliver accurate air quality forecasts.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: ANN with multiple Dense layers.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and train-test splitting.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.
- Supports extension to real-time AQI prediction.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model Type:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
